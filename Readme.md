# Project Title

Advanced Node.js Backend with User Authentication and Social Features

## Description:

This project aims to develop a robust backend system utilizing Node.js and JavaScript, emphasizing security, user authentication, and social interactions.

## Features Implemented:

-   **User Authentication:** The system enables secure user signup and login processes, incorporating robust password hashing techniques. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) serve for authentication, alongside access and refresh tokens.

-   **Database Integration:** MongoDB serves as the database system, with Mongoose functioning as the Object Data Modeling (ODM) tool for seamless interaction with the database, ensuring efficient management of user data and associations.

-   **Profile Image Management:** Integration with Cloudinary facilitates effortless uploading and management of profile and cover images, enhancing user personalization options and overall experience.

## Planned Features:

-   **Video Upload:** Upcoming enhancements include the integration of video upload functionality, empowering users to share videos within the platform's community.

-   **Social Interactions:** Users will be able to post and interact with "tweets" or short messages, similar to a social media platform. This feature will enable users to engage with each other's content and build a sense of community within the platform.
